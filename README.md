# BESM 3rd Edition Character Assistant

**BESM3CA** is a character creator for the third edition of the BESM (Big Eyes, Small Mouth) roleplaying game.  It is currently a 64-bit Windows application using .Net 5.0.  Supported operating systems are Windows 7 x64 and higher.

Files can be saved in _.xml_ format which can be reloaded later, or exported to _.txt_ for easier reading/manual formatting/printing etc.

The full list of 3rd Edition BESM character options are all enabled and supported and will calculate the relevant point costs accordingly.

This project is currently in development and therefore further features are planned but not yet available including:
* Printing/formatted text output
* Calculation of derived values/effects from attibutes
* Cross-platform support
* Alternate editions of BESM (e.g. 4th edition) or alternate RPG systems

Inspired by, but **not** based on or in anyway affiliated with _[BESMCG](http://www.technofetish.net/index.html)_, a character editor for BESM 2nd Edition.
